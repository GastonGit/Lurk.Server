# Basic description of the software

2. Watch for a high usage of certain emotes within a short period of time
3. During such an event, create a clip
4. Add the clip url to an array.
5. Cycle the clips from the array on a website.

# FAQ
### Why do I have to manually unmute?
Because Chrome does not allow websites to autoplay unmuted videos, for more details see https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes
### Why does X streamer never show up?
The streamer might have clip creation restricted to subscribers or has been explicitly filtered out.
### Why are all clips 30 seconds long? Why are some clips badly timed, ending abruptly or missing context?
The official API for Twitch clips is currently very limited
